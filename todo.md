# APEXHUB Upgrade Todo

## Infrastructure
- [x] Upgrade to web-db-user (backend + database + user auth)
- [x] Database schema: monthly_snapshots table + active_trades table (per-user)
- [x] tRPC procedures: journal.listSnapshots / upsertSnapshot / deleteSnapshot / getActiveTrade / upsertActiveTrade / deleteActiveTrade
- [x] LLM wiring (`extractTradeFromScreenshot` procedure using invokeLLM + storagePut)
- [ ] Dedicated `trades` table + per-trade CRUD procedures (currently serialized inside monthly snapshot JSON)

## Backend
- [x] Seed historical months (Dec 2025 - Apr 2026) into DB on first login
- [x] `extractTradeFromScreenshot` (LLM vision → parsed trade fields)
- [x] vitest coverage for journal router (5 tests, passing)
- [x] vitest coverage for screenshot extraction (3 tests, passing)

## Frontend
- [x] Remove "TRADE" (active trade), SYNC, RESET buttons from topbar
- [x] ADD TRADE wizard: Step 1 screenshot scan + identification, Step 2 prices/P&L, Step 3 links & save
- [x] Screenshot scanner uses LLM vision to prefill form fields
- [x] Period filter above KPIs/charts (ALL / THIS MONTH / 30D / 60D / 90D / CUSTOM)
- [x] Apply period filter to KPIs, equity/DD/PnL chart, symbol chart, win/loss donut, and trades table
- [x] Editable Starting Balance per month (click pencil on Starting KPI; disabled while period filter active)
- [x] Show P/L in both $ and % across KPI cards (Best/Worst), trade drawer banner, desktop + mobile trade rows, symbol performance table
- [x] Authenticated users: add / edit / delete trade, delete month, active trade all persist to DB via snapshot upsert
- [x] Auto-hydrate current month from server on reload and when switching months

## Known gaps / nice-to-haves
- [ ] Remove localStorage fallback once anonymous browsing is no longer desired
- [ ] Optimistic-update + rollback tests for trade mutations
- [ ] End-to-end test for the screenshot wizard in the UI
